A photorealistic portrait of MGNPERSON, a young Turkish woman with dark brown wavy bob-length hair and warm brown eyes, looking at the camera with a gentle peaceful smile during golden hour. She is wearing a light flowy white blouse, and warm sunset backlight creates a radiant rim light glowing along her hair and shoulders, bathing the entire scene in rich golden tones. The background is a softly blurred outdoor nature setting filled with warm golden bokeh circles from the low sun. Shot on a 105mm lens at f/1.8, head and shoulders framing, with the backlight producing a luminous halo effect around her silhouette.
