A photorealistic portrait of MGNPERSON, a young Turkish woman with dark brown wavy bob-length hair and warm brown eyes, turned at a three-quarter angle facing left with a relaxed slight smile while looking back toward the camera. She is wearing a cream colored chunky knit sweater, framed from the head and shoulders against a warm neutral beige background. Soft diffused window light enters from the right, creating gentle modeling on her cheekbones and a warm, inviting atmosphere. Shot on a 70mm lens with shallow depth of field for a natural editorial feel.
