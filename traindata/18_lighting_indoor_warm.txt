A photorealistic portrait of MGNPERSON, a young Turkish woman with dark brown wavy bob-length hair and warm brown eyes, looking at the camera with a cozy relaxed and slightly tired but content expression. She is wearing an oversized oatmeal colored knit sweater, photographed in intimate head and shoulders framing with warm tungsten indoor evening lamp lighting casting a soft amber glow across her skin. The background is a softly blurred interior with a sofa and pillows, reinforcing the warm domestic atmosphere with rich golden tones throughout the image. Shot on a 50mm lens at f/1.8, capturing the inviting warmth of the low indoor light.
