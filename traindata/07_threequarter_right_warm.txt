A photorealistic portrait of MGNPERSON, a young Turkish woman with dark brown wavy bob-length hair and warm brown eyes, turned at a three-quarter angle facing right with a warm genuine smile while looking at the camera. She wears a dusty pink soft cotton t-shirt, with golden hour window light streaming in from the left and casting a warm glow across her skin. The soft warm interior background is gently out of focus, enhancing the intimate and welcoming mood of the portrait. Shot on an 85mm lens at f/1.8, head and shoulders framing with rich warm tones throughout.
