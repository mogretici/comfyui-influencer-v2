A photorealistic portrait of MGNPERSON, a young Turkish woman with dark brown wavy bob-length hair and warm brown eyes, shown in a full left-facing side profile with a serene calm expression. Her shoulders are bare, and a rim light from behind creates a luminous glowing outline along her hair and the contour of her face, separating her beautifully from the clean white background. The lighting is minimal and dramatic, emphasizing the elegant silhouette of her profile from head and neck only. Shot on a 135mm lens at f/2.0 with precise focus on her features and a bright, high-key aesthetic.
