A photorealistic portrait of MGNPERSON, a young Turkish woman with dark brown wavy bob-length hair and warm brown eyes, turned at a three-quarter angle facing left with a thoughtful expression, her gaze cast slightly downward and away from the camera. She wears a simple black scoop neck top, set against a softly blurred bookshelf background that adds warmth and texture to the scene. Warm indoor ambient light gently fills the frame, casting subtle shadows that emphasize her contemplative mood. Shot on an 85mm lens at f/2.0 with a shallow depth of field that keeps her features sharp against the diffused interior.
