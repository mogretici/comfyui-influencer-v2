A photorealistic portrait of MGNPERSON, a young Turkish woman with dark brown wavy bob-length hair and warm brown eyes, staring directly into the camera with a serious intense contemplative expression and no smile. Her shoulders are bare, and the tight close-up framing draws attention to the strength in her gaze. Dramatic single-source side lighting from the left creates deep chiaroscuro shadows across the right half of her face, with a very dark almost black moody background that heightens the tension. Shot on a 135mm lens at f/2.0 with precise focus on her eyes, evoking a fine art portrait aesthetic.
