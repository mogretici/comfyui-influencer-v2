A photorealistic portrait of MGNPERSON, a young Turkish woman with dark brown wavy hair pulled up in a messy high bun with loose strands framing her face, and warm brown eyes looking directly at the camera with a natural everyday expression. She is wearing a white scoop neck top that shows her collarbones, in a close-up portrait framing that captures her full face, neck, and ears. Soft natural front light illuminates her features evenly against a clean neutral background, highlighting the casual texture of her updo. Shot on an 85mm lens at f/2.0 with sharp detail on her face and the wispy loose strands of hair.
