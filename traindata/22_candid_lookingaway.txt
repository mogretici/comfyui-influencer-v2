A photorealistic portrait of MGNPERSON, a young Turkish woman with dark brown wavy bob-length hair and warm brown eyes, looking away to the left and slightly upward with a candid unposed dreamy expression, not engaging with the camera. She is wearing a light beige off-white cotton top with a relaxed neckline showing her collarbone, framed from the head, shoulders, and upper chest. Soft warm afternoon daylight from the right side gently models her features and catches highlights along her jawline, with blurred outdoor trees and sky forming a natural bokeh-filled background. Shot on a 105mm lens at f/1.8 with shallow depth of field, capturing a contemplative stolen moment.
