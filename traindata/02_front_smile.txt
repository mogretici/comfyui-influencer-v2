A photorealistic portrait of MGNPERSON, a young Turkish woman with dark brown wavy bob-length hair and warm brown eyes, facing the camera with a soft gentle smile. She wears a white crew neck cotton t-shirt, with the framing capturing her head and shoulders against a clean white background. Soft diffused studio lighting wraps evenly around her face, minimizing shadows and creating a bright, approachable look. Shot on a 50mm lens at f/2.8 with even studio illumination.
