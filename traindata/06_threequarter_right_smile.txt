A photorealistic portrait of MGNPERSON, a young Turkish woman with dark brown wavy bob-length hair and warm brown eyes, turned at a three-quarter angle facing right with a gentle warm smile directed at the camera. She is wearing a white linen button-up shirt with an open collar, framed from the head and shoulders against a neutral light gray background. Soft Rembrandt lighting from the left creates a defined triangle of light on her far cheek, adding dimension and a classic portrait quality to the image. Shot on a 105mm portrait lens at f/2.0 with beautiful subject isolation.
