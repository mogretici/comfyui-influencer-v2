A photorealistic portrait of MGNPERSON, a young Turkish woman with dark brown wavy bob-length hair and warm brown eyes, looking directly into the camera with a confident serious expression and a slight determined frown. She is wearing an olive green t-shirt, photographed from the head and shoulders with blurred green park trees softly visible in the background. The scene is lit by overcast outdoor daylight providing even, diffused illumination across her features. Shot on an 85mm lens at f/1.8 with creamy bokeh separating her from the natural setting.
