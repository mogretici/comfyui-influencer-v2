A photorealistic portrait of MGNPERSON, a young Turkish woman with dark brown wavy bob-length hair and warm brown eyes, looking directly at the camera with a calm neutral expression. She is wearing a simple heather gray crew neck t-shirt, framed from the head and shoulders. Soft natural window light falls from the left side, gently illuminating her skin with subtle shadows on the right, against a clean neutral light gray background. Shot on an 85mm lens with shallow depth of field, producing a crisp studio-quality headshot.
